# Dataviz_project
This project aims at developing a simple app that advises everyone - according to his own soccer tastes - which games he should make sure not to miss during the Euro Championship in June 2016

We're grad students at ENSAE ParisTech, an engineering school specialized in Statistics and Data Science.
